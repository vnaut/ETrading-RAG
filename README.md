This project is part of my work during my Summer 2024 internship at E-Trading Consultants. It implements a question-answering system using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a highly contextualized AI model tailored to proprietary company data. By integrating retrieval capabilities with generative models, this system allows users to perform complex tasks and ask queries based on specific company documentation, delivering precise and relevant answers.
